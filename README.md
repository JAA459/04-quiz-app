# 04-quiz-app
In this assignment I was given the task to create a quiz in which users would be asked questions that are JavaScript related once they selected the start button. Once the start button is selected and the questions appear, a timer of 60 seconds will begin. If the user answers incorrectly 15 seconds will be taken off the time. If the user runs out of time they will be prompted and directed to the final page where they can unput there name and save there score. There the user can navigate to the home menu or play again. Once in the home menu the user can view there top 5 high scores.
